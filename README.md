## Background ##

Insight Data Engineering offers a 7-week, intensive professional training fellowship program to help software engineers and academic programmers to make a career transition to data engineering. 

At the program, the Fellows build proof-of-concept data platforms using open source, distributed technologies. Due to the rapid development of the technologies, the dev setup of each tool often needs an update every 2 - 3 months. This repo provides sample codes to test the functionality of tools as they get updated and covers the technologies below in the Data Engineering Ecosystems. 

* Apache Spark
* Apachel Kafka
* PostgreSQL
* Flask
